1,"Acoustic Startle and Pre-pulse Inhibition (PPI)","The acoustic startle response is characterized by an exaggerated flinching response to an unexpected strong auditory stimulus (pre-pulse). This response can be attenuated when it is preceded by a weaker stimulus (pre-pulse) and is the principle underlying pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). PPI has been described in numerous species, including mice and humans and provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating reflecting the ability of an animal to successfully integrate and inhibit sensory information. Several clinical studies have shown that a number of human disorders have impaired PPI including: schizophrenia, Huntington&rsquo;s disease, fragile X syndrome, and autism. The acoustic startle and PPI paradigm is therefore largely used to assess sensorimotor gating and the effects of a number of treatment modalities such as putative anti-psychotics, and to explore genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying behaviors of relevance to psychosis (Geyer, 1999; Ouagazzal et al., 2001).Ontological description: MP:0002067 - abnormal sensory capabilities/reflexes/nociception.",1
2,"Adult LacZ","To stain adult mutant  and control tissues for bacterial beta-galactosidase (LacZ) activity in order to assess the adult organ, tissue, substructure and cell type of gene expression of IKMC alleles utilizing a LacZ reporter.  Description: Adult mouse tissues are scored for presence of LacZ staining which is distinct from either nonspecific staining observed in wildtype control mice, or is too faint to score as present.  Intensity of staining is not required but can be reported.   Anatomical terms to localize staining to the organ, structure, substructure, or cell type will use standard mouse anatomy ontology terms.",0

17,"Grip Strength","The grip strength test is used to measure the neuromuscular function as maximal muscle strength of forelimbs and combined forelimbs and hind limbs. These are assessed by the grasping applied by the mouse on a grid that is connected to a sensor. Three trials are carried out in succession measuring forelimb-strength only, followed by three successive trials measuring the combined forelimb/hindlimb grip strength. All grip strength values obtained are normalized against mouse body weight.Ontological description: MP:0001515 - abnormal grip strength.",1

28,"Hematology","Hematological assessment of blood determines blood cell counts (white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets) and additional hematological parameters (hematocrit, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration) can be derived using these indices.

32,"Indirect Calorimetry","Indirect calorimetry provides detailed information on the energy metabolism of mutant mice. Energy expenditure is evaluated through indirect calorimetry by measuring oxygen consumption with an open flow respirometric system. CO2 and O2 sensors measure the difference in CO2 and O2 concentrations in air volumes flowing through control or animal cages. The amount of oxygen consumed over a given period of time can thus be calculated, as far as the air flow through the cage is known. Data are expressed as ml O2 h-1animal-1. The system also monitors CO2 production, therefore, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and heat production can be calculated. An activity and food and water intake monitoring system can also be integrated into the set up in order to investigate circadian pattern and behaviour.Ontological description: MP:0005266 - abnormal metabolism.",0

34,"Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT)","The glucose tolerance test measures the clearance of an intraperitoneally injected glucose load from the body. It is used to detect disturbances in glucose metabolism that can be linked to human conditions such as diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Animals are fasted for approximately 16 hours, fasted blood glucose levels are determined before a solution of glucose is administered by intra-peritoneal (IP) injection. Subsequently, the blood glucose level is measured at different time points during the following 2 hours.Ontological description: MP:0005559 - increased circulating glucose level, MP:0005560 - decreased circulating glucose level, MP:0005293 - impaired glucose tolerance, MP:0005292 - improved glucose tolerance, MP:0005291           abnormal glucose tolerance, MP:0000188 - abnormal circulating glucose level.",1
