Acoustic Startle and Pre-pulse Inhibition (PPI),TRUE,"The acoustic startle response is characterized by an exaggerated flinching response to an unexpected strong auditory stimulus (pre-pulse). This response can be attenuated when it is preceded by a weaker stimulus (pre-pulse) and is the principle underlying pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). PPI has been described in numerous species, including mice and humans and provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating reflecting the ability of an animal to successfully integrate and inhibit sensory information. Several clinical studies have shown that a number of human disorders have impaired PPI including: schizophrenia, Huntington&rsquo;s disease, fragile X syndrome, and autism. The acoustic startle and PPI paradigm is therefore largely used to assess sensorimotor gating and the effects of a number of treatment modalities such as putative anti-psychotics, and to explore genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying behaviors of relevance to psychosis (Geyer, 1999; Ouagazzal et al., 2001).Ontological description: MP:0002067 - abnormal sensory capabilities/reflexes/nociception.",1,

All grip strength values obtained are normalized against mouse body weight.Ontological description: MP:0001515 - abnormal grip strength.",17,

Indirect Calorimetry,FALSE,"Indirect calorimetry provides detailed information on the energy metabolism of mutant mice. Energy expenditure is evaluated through indirect calorimetry by measuring oxygen consumption with an open flow respirometric system. CO2 and O2 sensors measure the difference in CO2 and O2 concentrations in air volumes flowing through control or animal cages. The amount of oxygen consumed over a given period of time can thus be calculated, as far as the air flow through the cage is known. Data are expressed as ml O2 h-1animal-1. The system also monitors CO2 production, therefore, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and heat production can be calculated. An activity and food and water intake monitoring system can also be integrated into the set up in order to investigate circadian pattern and behaviour.Ontological description: MP:0005266 - abnormal metabolism.",32,
